Whoop can change, update, or add or remove provisions of these Terms, at any time by posting the updated Terms on the Services or by notifying you via the App. By using the Services after Whoop has updated the Terms, you are agreeing to all the updated Terms; if you do not agree with any of the updated Terms, you must stop using Services.

General Use.

The Services may not be available in all locations, and we may block access to the Services from certain locations based on your device’s geolocation information; we may add to or remove the areas in which the Services are not available at any time, without notice to you.

By using, you represent, acknowledge and agree that you are at least 18 years of age, or if you are under 18 years of age, but are at least 17 years old (a “Minor”), that that you have received your parent’s or legal guardian’s permission to use the Services and agree to these Terms.

The Materials have not been verified or authenticated in whole or in part by Whoop, and they may include inaccuracies or typographical or other errors. Whoop does not warrant the accuracy of timeliness of the Materials contained on the Services.

WHOOP, FOR ITSELF AND ITS LICENSORS, MAKES NO EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, OR GUARANTEES IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES, THE SERVICES, OR ANY MATERIALS RELATING TO THE QUALITY, SUITABILITY, TRUTH, ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF ANY INFORMATION OR MATERIAL CONTAINED OR PRESENTED ON THE SERVICES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE MATERIALS.

Dispute Resolution and Arbitration; Class Action Waiver.

Please read this carefully. It affects your rights.

Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to a customer’s satisfaction by contacting us at [http://www.yikyakapp.com/support]. This Provision facilitates the prompt and efficient resolution of any disputes that may arise between you and Whoop. Arbitration is a form of private dispute resolution in which persons with a dispute waive their rights to file a lawsuit, to proceed in court and to a jury trial, and instead submit their disputes to a neutral third person (or arbitrator) for a binding decision. You have the right to opt-out of this Provision (as explained below), which means you would retain your right to litigate your disputes in a court, either before a judge or jury.

Please read this Provision carefully. It provides that all Disputes between you and Whoop shall be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration replaces the right to go to court. In the absence of this arbitration agreement, you may otherwise have a right or opportunity to bring claims in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate in or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including, but not limited to, class actions). Except as otherwise provided, entering into this agreement constitutes a waiver of your right to litigate claims and all opportunity to be heard by a judge or jury. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. The arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney’s fees).

For the purpose of this Provision, “Whoop” means Whoop and its parents, subsidiary, and affiliate companies, and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents. The term “Dispute” means any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Whoop regarding any aspect of your relationship with Whoop, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including, but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, or negligence), or any other legal or equitable theory, and includes the validity, enforceability or scope of this Provision (with the exception of the enforceability of the Class Action Waiver clause below). “Dispute” is to be given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced, and shall include any claims against other parties relating to services or products provided or billed to you (such as Whoop’s licensors, suppliers, dealers or third-party vendors) whenever you also assert claims against us in the same proceeding.

WE EACH AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BELOW, ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, AS DEFINED ABOVE, WHETHER PRESENTLY IN EXISTENCE OR BASED ON ACTS OR OMISSIONS IN THE PAST OR IN THE FUTURE, WILL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY AND FINALLY BY BINDING ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PROVISION.

General.

Whoop prefers to advise you if we feel you are not complying with these Terms and to recommend any necessary corrective action. However, certain violations of these Terms, as determined by Whoop, may result in immediate termination of your access to the Services without prior notice to you. The Federal Arbitration Act, Washington state law and applicable U.S. federal law, without regard to the choice or conflicts of law provisions, will govern these Terms. Foreign laws do not apply. The United Nations on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and any laws based on the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (UCITA) shall not apply to this Agreement. Except for Disputes subject to arbitration as described above, any disputes relating to these Terms or the Services will be heard in the courts located in King County in the State of Washington. If any of these Terms is found to be inconsistent with applicable law, then such term shall be interpreted to reflect the intentions of the parties, and no other terms will be modified. Whoop’s failure to enforce any of these Terms is not a waiver of such term. These Terms are the entire agreement between you and Whoop and supersede all prior or contemporaneous negotiations, discussions or agreements between you and Whoop about the Services. The proprietary rights, disclaimer of warranties, representations made by you, indemnities, limitations of liability and general provisions shall survive any termination of these Terms.
